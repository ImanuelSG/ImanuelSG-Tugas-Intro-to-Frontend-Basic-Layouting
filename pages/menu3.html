        <h2 class="Subjudul"> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thaw puff pastry in the fridge overnight or on the counter for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, half and half, and salt and pepper. Cook in a skillet over medium high heat, stirring frequently. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan.
                </li>
                <li>Once eggs are cooked, add green chiles. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Cut each pastry sheet into 4 equally sized squares. Place them on a greased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Cut out pieces of ham that will fit on one half of the pastry square and put one piece on each pastry square. Make sure to leave a margin on the edges for crimping the pies shut.</li>
                <li>Next, add a tomato slice to each pastry square on top of the ham.</li>
                <li>Then, scoop a small spoonful of egg mixture on to each pastry square on top of the tomato.</li>
                <li>Top the eggs with a pinch of shredded cheese.</li>
                <li>Fold the top piece of the pastry over the fillings and crimp the edges with a fork.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk one egg until combined. Using a pastry brush, brush a small amount of egg wash onto the top of each pastry.</li>
                <li>Top each pastry with another pinch of cheddar cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until pastry is puffed and golden brown.</li>
            
        </ol>
