        <h2 class="Subjudul"> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li>24 Fiber One English Muffins I found these at Costco</li>
            <li>2 16 oz tubes Turkey Breakfast Sausage (Jennie-O)</li>
            <li>9 eggs
                </li>
            <li>9 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>salt and pepper optional</li>
            <li>24 cheese slices (we used 2% milk American Flavored Kraft Singles 45 calories per slice)</li>
            <li>sliced tomato optional</li>
        
        
        </ul>
            
        <h2 class="Subjudul"> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Press the turkey sausage flat until it is completely covering the bottom of a 13x18 baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 15 minutes. The sausage will pull from the sides and it should look browned.</li>
            <li>While the sausage is baking beat together the eggs and milk, I like to add a little salt and pepper to the eggs but this is optional. 
                </li>
            <li>Pour the eggs in to another 13x18 baking sheet, that has been lined with cooking spray. Carefully place the eggs in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the eggs are no longer runny.</li>
            <li>Cut the sausage and eggs in to 24 equal squares. Open an english muffin and add a slice of sausage, egg, and cheese to each one.</li>
            <li>Put each completed sandwich into a sandwich baggie and freeze. I put all the sandwiches into a cardboard box in my freezer to help prevent freezer burn.</li>
            <li>When ready to eat, remove from freezer and plastic baggie, wrap in a paper towel, and microwave for 1 min 30 seconds on defrost (30%) then turn over and microwave on high for another 1 to 1.5 minutes. (I like to throw one in the fridge the night before so it thaws overnight, then just microwave on high for 1 min 30 seconds).</li>
            <li>I sometimes like to add a slice of tomato to my sandwich for added flavor.</li>
        </ol>
